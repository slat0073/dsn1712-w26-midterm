        <h1>Midnight in the City</h1>

        <p>A visual essay on silence, light, and movement after dark.</p>

        <img src="/city-hero.png" alt="Dark and rainy city street at night.">


        <h2>The City Changes</h2>

        <p>The city softens at night. Shadows stretch, streetlights hum, and windows glow like quiet beacons.</p>

        <p>Reflections shimmer on rain-slick pavement. The hum of distant traffic becomes a lullaby for those awake.</p>

        <p>“Cities have their own heartbeat after midnight.”</p>


        <h2>The People</h2>

        <p>Some move with purpose, others drift without urgency. The city transforms them, and they transform it in return.</p>


        <h1>Wanderers</h1>

        <p>They trace the edges of light and shadow, noticing the details daylight hides.</p>


        <h1>Observations After Midnight:</h1>

        <ul>Flickering neon reflected on wet sidewalks</ul>
        <ul>Steam rising from subway grates</ul>
        <ul>Quiet windows glowing in high-rise apartments</ul>

        <p>Each moment is a fragment of the city’s nocturnal story — ephemeral, delicate, and luminous.</p>


        <h2>After Hours</h2>

        <p>The night does not hide the city. It reveals layers invisible in daylight. Every shadow, every light, every reflection becomes a story.</p>

        <p>Traffic slows, the air hums with quiet energy. Alleyways whisper of journeys begun and journeys paused. The city is both still and alive.</p>

        <p>When morning returns, it does not erase the night. It layers another narrative on top, but the echoes remain for those who listen.</p>
